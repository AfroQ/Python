**Logic** 

The Boolean data type has only two values: 

- True and False (both beginning with capital letters).
- Comparison operators compare two values and evaluate to a Boolean value: 
  - ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
    == is a comparison operator, while = is the assignment operator for variables.
- Boolean operators (and, or, not) also evaluate to Boolean values.

```python
TRUE (1) AND FALSE (0)
1 AND 1 = 1 
1 AND 0 = 0
0 AND 1 = 0 
0 AND 0 = 0 

OR 
1 OR 1 = 1 
0 OR 1 = 1
0 OR 0 = 0

NOT (LOGICAL INVERSION)
```
